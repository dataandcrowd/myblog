      <description>Filling missing data = ImputationHow should we deal with missing data? Should we remove them or keep them? If NA is hardly noticed in the whole dataset, we can simply ignore them in our analysis by using na.rm = T. If not, then we need to do something to fill the gap.
In statistical terms, the process of replacing(filling) a gap is defined as imputation. There are various ways to imputate missing data, but since my focus is on time-series data, it has to at least take into account the (seasonal) trend to minimise possible errors.</description>
