      <description>HPC is not a local machine Today’s post is all about setting R on a HPC (High Performance Computing). HPC is also named as a supercomputer because it has many nodes and GB level of memory. People who work with a large set of data or work on parallel processing commonly use the HPC.
I presume most universities and research institutions have this massive system, but if you dont’ have a CompSci background, haven’t used the cluster before (but you are willing to), and you want to use R and spatial tools, this is a good place to start.</description>
