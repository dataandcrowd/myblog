      <description>This picture was taken on the 31st of July 2018 at Downing College. Do you see anything other than the yellowy grass? Well here is the hint: * The man with the white shirt is walking furiously towards the men. * The white shirt man is the porter of the college * The men are tourists
Yes, this is actually a scary situation to Cambridgians because only 1) fellows, 2) people talking to a fellow, 3) gardener including gardening robots, and 4) ducks are allowed to walk on college grass.</description>
