      <description>Some of you may heard about Seoul’s air pollution at least once, but for those who never heard it before, you should see how severe the atmosphere is just by looking at the pictures below (Photos credited to Peter Han).
Pic 1This Photo was taken from the 50th floor of the IFC Building in Yeoido, Seoul on the 5th of March 2019. The dusty atmosphere restricts our vision too much that you can’t clealy see the far end of the River Han.</description>

      <description>This picture was taken on the 31st of July 2018 at Downing College. Do you see anything other than the yellowy grass? Well here is the hint: * The man with the white shirt is walking furiously towards the men.* The white shirt man is the porter of the college* The men are tourists
Yes, this is actually a scary situation to Cambridgians because only 1) fellows, 2) people talking to a fellow, 3) gardener including gardening robots, and 4) ducks are allowed to walk on college grass.</description>
