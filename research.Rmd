My research mainly stands on the quantitative side of geography. This includes miscellaneous GIS approaches, geo-statistics (i.e. clustering, spatial autocorrelation), and agent-based modelling. The topics I worked on through my academic path varied from aquatic ecosystem, disease to urban transport, but my recent attention has lied on human-environment interaction, in a pollution context: how air pollution and urbanisation can make people and communities physically and socio-economically vulnerable.
