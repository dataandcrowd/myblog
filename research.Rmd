My research mainly stands on the quantitative side of geography. This includes miscellaneous GIS approaches, geostatistics (i.e. clustering, spatial autocorrelation), and agent-based modelling. The topics I worked on through my academic path varied from aquatic ecosystem, disease to urban transport, but my recent attention has lied on human-environment interaction, in a pollution context: how air pollution and urbanisation can make people and communities physically and socioeconomically vulnerable.

### Ph.D Research: Assessing Seoul Pedestrian's Exposure to Air Pollution using Agent-based Modelling
![](images/seoul.jpg){width=50% .external}

My PhD research aims to estimate the potential health vulnerability to air pollution in megacities, particularly in Seoul. Since Seoul is one of the densest cities in the world, citizens are more likely to be exposed to a large amounts of pollutants generated from industrial sites, vehicle emission, and harmful substances flowing from other areas, which in turn can cause lung and cardiovascular disorders. My other concern is how individual activities and their socioeconomic status can be affected by pollution exposure. For instance, residents near pollutant areas are more likely to be affected and also socially deprived.

The overall purpose of this study is to estimate potential vulnerability of exposure to air pollution in Seoul. These results will provide new insights for suggesting a reduction policy for the populationâ€™s future exposure matters. There are several question to reach this objective: <br><br>
  1.	How can vulnerability to air pollution be conceptualised to take full account of exposure and sensitivity? <br>
  2.	What do spatial and temporal trends of pollution reveal about its distribution and how are they related to socioeconomic / physical indicators? <br>
  3.	How can such a conceptualisation be applied to an agent-based modelling framework? <br>
  4.	How does the response pattern from pollution vary between population groups and how does it appear on the geographical landscape after applying various modelling techniques? <br>
  5.	What do GIS and agent-based modelling scenarios for the case city suggest about future patterns of risk and the need for interventions, e.g. in terms of protection and support? <br>

My first paper [**An Agent-Based Assessment of Health Vulnerability to Long-Term Particulate Exposure in Seoul Districts**](http://jasss.soc.surrey.ac.uk/22/1/12.html) uses a proof-of-concept model to estimate population health loss between Seoul's wealthy and deprived districts after a long-term pollution exposure.
