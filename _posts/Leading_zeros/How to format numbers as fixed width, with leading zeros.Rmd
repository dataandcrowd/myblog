As one of the R Users, I feel quite annoying when I encounter string files which have have counters at the end `myfile_1.jpg, myfile_2.jpg,....,myfile_11.jpg`. </br></br> Why does this bother me? Simple. This is because the sorting system in the R environment only sorts files from their higher digits. For example, in R, the files are sorted in this order: `myfile_1.jpg, myfile_11.jpg, ..., myfile_19.jpg, myfile_2.jpg, myfile_20.jpg`and so on. But for analytic purposes, we need our first nine files ordered correctly.  </br></br>

To solve this we have two options. First, to coercely change the sorting method to a Windows format.

```r
 setwd("SetDirectory")
 library(gtools)
 files  <- list.files(pattern= "*.tif")
 my <- mixedsort(sort(files))
```
 
 </br>

Alternatively, it might be better to add a leading zero file to the single unit files between zero and nine. 
```r
for (i in 1:9){
  filez <- list.files(pattern = paste("*_", i, ".tif", sep = ""))
  sapply(filez,FUN=function(eachPath){
    file.rename(from = eachPath, to = sub(pattern= paste(i,".tif", sep = ""),
    replacement= paste("0",i,".tif", sep = ""),eachPath))
  })
} 
``` 

Have fun!
