Hello there! Thank you for visiting my website. 

My name is Hyesop. **I am a [Research Associate](https://www.gla.ac.uk/schools/ges/staff/hyesopshin/) in the Department of Geography and Earth Sciences at Glasgow University**. 
People who aren't Korean find my name quite difficult to pronounce; besides I don't have an English name! So here is how you can call me: Hey, Sop!


My research mainly stands on the quantitative side of geography. This includes miscellaneous GIS approaches, geo-statistics (i.e. clustering, spatial autocorrelation), and agent-based modelling. The topics I worked on through my academic path varied from aquatic ecosystem, disease to urban transport.


You can find out about **some** of my projects under the projects menu. 

## Research Interests
 - Agent-based modelling
 - GIS
 - Nonlinear Statistics
 - Spatial Statistics
 - Urban Air Pollution
 - Urban Traffic
 - Volunteering Geographic Information (VGI)
 - Citizen Science

## Skills
- **R** for data related work: I have been using R since 2012 and whenever it makes sense, I use it for my projects.
- **NetLogo**: NetLogo has been my friend and fiend since 2013. This lad helped me two earn two important degrees in my life: Master/Ph.D
- **Git**: first rule of programming: always use version control.
