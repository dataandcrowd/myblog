I am a quantitative geographer interested in agent-based modelling to understand uncertainty and emergence in social phenomenon. My particular interest lies on how air pollution and urbanisation can make people and communities physically and socioeconomically vulnerable. Additionally, I work on miscellaneous GIS approaches, geostatistics (i.e. clustering, spatial autocorrelation) mostly in urban areas. I also work on state-of-the-art analyses to understand big data.

### Ph.D Research: Assessing Seoul Pedestrian's Exposure to Air Pollution using Agent-based Modelling
![](/images/seoul.jpg)

My PhD research aims to estimate the potential health vulnerability to air pollution in megacities, particularly in Seoul. Since Seoul is one of the densest cities in the world, citizens are more likely to be exposed to a large amounts of pollutants generated from industrial sites, vehicle emission, and harmful substances flowing from other areas, which in turn can cause lung and cardiovascular disorders. My other concern is how individual activities and their socioeconomic status can be affected by pollution exposure. For instance, residents near pollutant areas are more likely to be affected and also socially deprived.

With Agent-based modelling (ABM) and dispersal models, my first step is to examine the spatial and temporal effects of urban air pollution that could affect population health. Subsequently, I will develop scenario models in order to estimate population level health change as well as environmental impacts.
