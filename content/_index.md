**I am a [doctoral student](https://www.geog.cam.ac.uk/people/shin/) in [the Geography department](https://www.geog.cam.ac.uk/) at [Cambridge University](https://www.cam.ac.uk/).**

You can find me on Twitter [@hyesop](https://twitter.com/hyesop) and GitHub [mrsensible](http://github.com/mrsensible/). Here is my [CV](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1lwYaDOyU9eUrTrQTe-YXRfB-wtiByKmk)

I worked as a research assistant at the Institute for Korean Regional Studies of Seoul National University (2014-2017). After I was awarded a Master from the [department of geography](http://www.geog.snu.ac.kr/) at Seoul National University, I worked as a research engineer at [GEO C&I(corp)](http://www.geocni.com/kor/sub/sub0601.asp?snm=400) working on GIS projects that include aquatic ecosystems, criminal GIS, etc.

My research interest lies on a broad range of geocomputation, GIS, geostatistics, and agent-based modelling(ABM). At Cambridge, my doctoral project looks at how air pollution and urbanisation can affect pedestrian's exposure and travel patterns using agent-based simulations. I am a fellow of European Social Simulation Association (ESSA), and Cambridge Philosophical Society.
