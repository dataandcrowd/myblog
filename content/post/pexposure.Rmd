# Rationale

- Ignoring the spatiotemporal variability of environmental risk factors and human mobility may lead to misleading results in exposure assessment (Kwan, 2017)

--

> 
- **Where people live** is often not the only important factor in determining their exposure to environmental factors
- Rather, **where people visit** and **how much time they spend at** a particualr location are more relevant to assessing the effects of environmental factors on people's health behaviours or outcomes
