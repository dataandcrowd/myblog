From the previous blog, you might have noticed the rationale of using high performance computing (HPC), and how fast it is to obtain results compared to our local machines. Having installed all the software requirements on the HPC, today's post is to simulate a *NetLogo* model of my Ph.D work in R using an **nlrx** package.

nlrx has promoted its uniqueness for adopting XML application to speed things up as well as reporting results framed as BehaviorSpace (https://ccl.northwestern.edu/netlogo/docs/behaviorspace.html). What I found great about this tool was that `headless.sh` is embedded in the sourcecode
