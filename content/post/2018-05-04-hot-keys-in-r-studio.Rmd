I was attending an R couse in the University of Leeds Course *R for Transport Applications*, and was utterly surprised to hear something really rudimentary but wasn't noticed before: Hot-Keys! To view all Hot Keys, all you need to do is simply hold  `Shift + Alt + K`. That's it! Once you know some keys during your coding, your work will become less burdon and joyful! </br>
