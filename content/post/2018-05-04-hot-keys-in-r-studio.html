<p>I was attending an R couse in the University of Leeds Course <em>R for Transport Applications</em>, and was utterly surprised to hear something really rudimentary but wasn’t noticed before: Hot-Keys! To view all Hot Keys, all you need to do is simply hold <code>Shift + Alt + K</code>. That’s it! Once you know some keys during your coding, your work will become less burdon and joyful! </br> <img src="/post/2018-05-04-hot-keys-in-r-studio_files/shortcut.PNG" /></p>
