<p>This picture was taken on the 31st of July 2018 at <a href="http://www.dow.cam.ac.uk/">Downing College</a>. Do you see anything other than the yellowy grass? Well here is the hint: <br>
* The man with the white shirt is walking furiously towards the men.
* The white shirt man is the porter of the college
* The men are tourists</p>
<p>Yes, this is actually a scary situation to Cambridgians because only 1) fellows, 2) people talking to a fellow, 3) gardener including gardening robots, and 4) ducks are allowed to walk on college grass.</p>
<p>So, I would encourage tourists to read the <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/what-to-know-before-starting-at-the-university-of-cambridge-2016-9?r=US&amp;IR=T">dos and donâ€™ts</a> before coming, otherwise you will porters yelling at you!</p>
