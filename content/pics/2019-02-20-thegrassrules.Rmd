This picture was taken on the 31st of July 2018 at [Downing College](http://www.dow.cam.ac.uk/). Do you see anything other than the yellowy grass? Well here is the hint: <br>
* The man with the white shirt is walking furiously towards the men.
* The white shirt man is the porter of the college
* The men are tourists


Yes, this is actually a scary situation to Cambridgians because only 1) fellows, 2) people talking to a fellow, 3) gardener including gardening robots, and 4) ducks are allowed to walk on college grass.

So, I would encourage tourists to read the [dos and don'ts](https://www.businessinsider.com/what-to-know-before-starting-at-the-university-of-cambridge-2016-9?r=US&IR=T) before coming, otherwise you will porters yelling at you!
